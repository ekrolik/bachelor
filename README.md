### Semiclassical and Classical Methods for Dark Matter Void Evolution

#### Abstract:
We investigate the differences between classical and semiclassical methods for the evolution of wave-like dark matter in cosmic voids. The classical approach is based on the Zeldovich approximation where we especially evaluate the evolution after the intersection of particles in the so-called multi-streaming regime. The semiclassical setup consists of a free Schrödinger equation and one with an additional quantum pressure potential. Both formulations are compared to evaluate the impact of a cosmic void on the quantum pressure potential. Our setup consists of an initial velocity field with particles moving away from the center of our box, creating a void. The initial densities are an initial void and an initial homogeneous region. The semiclassical and classical methods match very well until shell-crossing, while after shell-crossing the semiclassical evolution shows interferences at the void walls. The presence of an initial void increases the effect of the quantum pressure in the Schrödinger equation.
